CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION IN REAL TIME WITH MACHINE LEARNING
    The credit card fraud is mostly come in financial services. The credit card fraud is generated huge number of problems in every year. Lack of research on this credit card problem and submits the real-world credit card fraud analyzes, that is issues. In this paper is introduced best data mining algorithm called “machine learning algorithm”, which is utilized to recognize the credit card fraud, so initially use this algorithm and it is one of the standard model. 
    Then, secondly apply the hybrid methods namely, “AdaBoost and majority vote method”. Use this model efficacy, which is evaluated, and then use the credit card data set it is publicly available one. The financial institution included true world data set, so it is taking and analyzed. In this robustness algorithm additionally evaluate the noise added data samples. This concept is used in experiment and then produce the result positively indicate the hybrid method, that is majority voting, it provides good accuracy rates in credit card fraud detection.
